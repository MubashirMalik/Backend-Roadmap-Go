# Type Casting

Type casting happens when we assign a value of one data type to another data type. Statically typed languages like C++ and Java provide the support for Implicit Type Conversion. Still, the Go language is different, as it doesnâ€™t support an Automatic Type Conversion or Implicit Type Conversion even if the data types are compatible.

## Types of Typecasting
1. Implicit Typecasting
2. Explicit Typecasting

## Syntax
If you want to convert a value from one data type to another, you must follow the following syntax.
```
newDataTypeVariable = T(oldDataTypeVariable)
```
Where T is the new data type.
## Example
```
var badboys int = 1921
// explicit type conversion
var badboys2 float64 = float64(badboys)
```

## It conversion not casting!
In other programming languages we call it casting, but we don't do that here :P, rather we call it conversion.
